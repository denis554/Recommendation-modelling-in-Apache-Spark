    "## 1.3) Learning Algorithm - ALS\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is often used for recommender systems [1]. This is a group of techniques that aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix or item-item. \"Spark.ml currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. Spark.ml uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors.\" \n",
    "The implementation in Spark.ml has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\n",
    "- **numBlocks** is the number of blocks the users and items will be partitioned into in order to parallelize computation (defaults to 10).\n",
    "- **rank** is the number of latent factors in the model (defaults to 10).\n",
    "- **maxIter** is the maximum number of iterations to run (defaults to 10).\n",
    "- **regParam** specifies the regularization parameter in ALS (defaults to 1.0).\n",
    "- **implicitPrefs** specifies whether to use the explicit feedback ALS variant or one adapted for implicit feedback data (defaults to false which means using explicit feedback).\n",
    "- **alpha** is a parameter applicable to the implicit feedback variant of ALS that governs the baseline confidence in preference observations (defaults to 1.0).\n",
    "- **nonnegative** specifies whether or not to use nonnegative constraints for least squares (defaults to false).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing in the **rank** and the **maxIter** parameters. First because implicitPref, alpha, and nonnegative do not apply in our approach. Second, it would take too much time to do the training with many parameters. Third, there was no easy function which we could use to output the values for numBlocks and regParam.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicity vs Explicity\n",
    "We will utilize the explicity method since the dataset doesn't contain implicit feedback (e.g. views, clicks, purchases, likes, shares etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-Validation Split\n",
    "\"In addition to CrossValidator Spark also offers TrainValidationSplit for hyper-parameter tuning. TrainValidationSplit only evaluates each combination of parameters once, as opposed to k times in the case of CrossValidator. It is therefore less expensive, but will not produce as reliable results when the training dataset is not sufficiently large.\" [2]\n",

    "## 1.4) Considerations\n",
    "Since we are using collaborative filtering algorithm to predict ratings and recommend movies, we do not have a requirement for working with **Feature Extractors, Transformers and Selectors**, since the algorithm only requires a user-item matrix and user ratings [1]. Therefore, we will focus more on the modeling and commenting on the results for different parameters. Also, at the end of this project we will use our trained system to recommend movies for a new user and print out the most relevant recommended movies based on his initial ratings.\n",

    "## 3) Conclusions and Discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a user-item collaborative filtering approach which treats the values in the user-items matrix as explicit user preferences (i.e. ratings directly given by the user). The ALS algorithm in Spark decomposes the user-item matrix into a product of latent factor matrices which are then used for predicting ratings[1]. The Mlib library also provides an option for Implicit feedback to treat values in the user-item matrix implicitly as user preferences (i.e. clicks, views etc.) where the higher the number, the larger the level of confidence in user preferences [2]. Based on this information, latent factors are inferred. This is more computationally expensive than the explicit approach but is more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first trained and tested our model without grid search on varied size datasets, ranging from 80 to 80,000 rows. With smaller data set sizes (below 8000 rows), we can see the Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) on the training set is relatively low but the test RMSE is high (3.7).  this is due to overfitting. As the training set is increasing further upto 80,000 rows the training error increases and test error decreases to 1.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then implemented a parameter grid search approach on the entire smaller Movielens dataset (100,000 rows) and the largest dataset(20M rows, using the rank and the number of iterations as our machine learning parameters. The larger the rank, generally the better our model is, as more latent factors are used. However, the downside is the computational time required. We chose an arbitary range of values for our initial training parameters in our parameter grid. The parameters of the best model of our grid search were rank(5) and number of iterations(5). We used the RMSE as our evaluation metric on our training and test data sets. The test RMSE for the 20M dataset showed an improvement in accuracy relative to the smaller dataset (reduction in RMSE from 0.92 to 0.82). However, the downside was a large increase in computational time from approximately 5 minutes for the smaller dataset to 54 minutes for the largest dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the last section, we have used our trained model to recommended additional movies for a new user based on ratings given for 10 movies. The new user has rated crime/action movies highly (5) and non-crime/action movies low. Using our trained model, the recommendation provides reasonable suggestions for alternative movies with crime/action genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we achieved a system that can recommend movies based on the user's preferences (ratings). Although this is an efficient way to predict non available ratings and therefore recommend products, there is still some issues which we came across in this work. Firstly, there is the problem of new users who have not rated the movies i.e. cold start problem[1]. This generated 'NaN; prediction estimates for these users and hence had to be removed from the dataset. Secondly, collaborative filtering only really has a good accuracy with larger training data set size. \n",
